This project implements a time series and machine learning-based model to predict gold prices using historical data. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, 
and applying linear regression to identify trends over time. The model is evaluated using metrics such as R² score and RMSE to assess accuracy. 
The dataset includes date-wise gold prices, which are converted to numeric form for modeling. Visualization tools like Matplotlib help in understanding trends and fit.
The goal is to provide reliable future price forecasts to assist in financial decision-making.

Data Collection: Import historical gold price data with date and price columns.

Preprocessing: Convert dates to numerical format and clean the dataset.

Visualization: Plot price trends over time to observe patterns.

Modeling: Apply linear regression to model the relationship between date and price.

Evaluation: Use R² score and RMSE to assess model accuracy.

Prediction: Forecast future gold prices and visualize predictions for insights.
